Smallworld XSD loader
=====================

Introduction
------------

Smallworld XSD Loader is a tool which generates an magik/object model from a given XSD, version 1.1. It provides easy access to contents of parsed XML documents which conform to the XSD.

The repository can be found at [Github](http://github.com/StevenLooman/sw_xsd_loader).

Notes
-----

This module was written with supporting one project in mind. Not everything described by the XSD 1.1 standard is supported.

Also, this is not meant as a XML/XSD validator. If you want to check if your XML validates against a XSD, use proper tools for this.

Currently, only Smallworld 5 is supported. Older versions support Smallworld 4.
